    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer"> I would advise the client to use an open-standard authorization protocol or framework such as OneLogin, Okta, etc. Make use of trustworthy third-party applications and keep all applications up to date. Create an emergency plan and train your staff
        on how to deal with threats. Using continuous Deployment/Continuous integration tools that constantly checks changes to production for security weaknesses. Hire a network engineer to take care of network security and inform staff of which networks
        are safe to connect to. Implement an automatic user timeout so that user credentials are not left hanging in the browser for too long. </p>
